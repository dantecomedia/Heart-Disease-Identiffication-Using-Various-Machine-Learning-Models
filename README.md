# Heart-Disease-Identiffication-Using-Various-Machine-Learning-Models
Heart Disease Indenitification Using different machine learning approach

<h1>Introduction</h1>

In this kernel, i have tried to introduce various machine learning models and their implementation. The sole perpose of this kernel is to correctly identify the presence of any heart disease based on the given input. We proceed by giving a general introduction towards the disease followed by dataset's attributes and what they resemble. As we descend down the kernel , i have used various Machine Learning and Deep Learning approach.
Note:- This Kernel is subject to get updated as soon as i find something which can be revelant to the context.

<b>About Heart Disease </b>
<b>Heart disease is a general term that means that the heart is not working normally. Babies can be born with heart disease. This is called congenital heart disease. If people get heart disease later, it is called acquired heart disease. Most heart disease is acquired. The three most common types of acquired heart disease are:
Coronary Artery Disease (acronym CAD)
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
Bad Heart Rhythms </b>
<h3>DEATHS</h3>
Heart disease is the biggest killer of both men and women in the United States, England, Wales, and Canada. For example, heart disease causes 4 out of every 10 deaths in the United States.This is more than all kinds of cancer put together. Also, one person dies of heart disease about every minute in the United States alone.

<h1> Attributes and what does they resemble </h1>
**age**: Age of patient
**sex**:Sex, 1 for male
**cp**:chest pain
**trestbps**:resting blood pressure,more than 120 over 80 and less than 140 over 90 (120/80-140/90): You have a normal blood pressure reading but it is a little higher than it should be, and you should try to lower it. Make healthy changes to your lifestyle.
**chol**:serum cholesterol,shows the amount of triglycerides present. Triglycerides are another lipid that can be measured in the blood. 
**fbs**:fasting blood sugar larger 120mg/dl (1 true),less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal,100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes
**rest**:ecg resting electrode.
**thalach**:maximum heart rate achieved, maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age.
**exang**:exercise induced angina (1 yes),Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease.
**oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
**slope**:slope of peak exercise ST
**ca**:number of major vessel
**thal**:no explanation provided, but probably thalassemia (3 normal; 6 fixed defect; 7 reversable defect)
**result**:(1 anomality)	num	diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
